title: "Facts About Me"
---

I was born and raised in Hefei, Anhui, a city with over 2,000 years of history that became a prefectural seat during the Tang dynasty (7th century CE). I spent the first 21 years of my life in Hefei, my primary, secondary schools and my high school, as well as my alma mater, are all located there. 

My technical interests include mathematics and coding. In high school, I was a passionate math enthusiast. After only one and a half years, I sat for the Gaokao and also passed the University of Science and Technology of China’s specialized admission exam in physics and mathematics，which allowed me to enter university at a very young age.

After I arrived at KAUST, I adopted a calico cat I found on the doorstep of a local Al’baik fried chicken store. I named her Guoba (锅巴) after the crispy rice snack—her white, orange, and black fur reminded me of its colors.

A UK research team estimated that pet ownership delivers about £70,000 per year in life-satisfaction value (roughly $90,000), so Guoba continues to enrich my life immeasurably.

Nothing beats the feeling of being outdoors, hiking, in particular, makes me feel fully present. I am also a big fan of travelling and I have visited lots of countries. Here is my current foot print.
